# MonteCarloSimulationAdittonalCheck
contains an additional check for the effect of the new idea adopt chances on information diffusion in social networks

This check aims to check the effect of the new idea adopting chances on the inforamtion diffusion in social networks.
Specific this check checks how different probabilities of adopting this new idea effect the final  nubmer of agents infected by the information the passes in the network after time.
To use this additional check you need to add the SimulatorInDiffProb.py file to the project on this github repository :https://github.com/louiseadennis/MonteCarloInformationDiffusion 
to run this py file please sea the README file of this repository and run this file with same instructions.
